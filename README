Compiling and running code
----------------------------
1. Go to the code folder. Open terminal there.
$ g++ main.cpp -O3
(Note : Please compile using -O3, otherwise a lot of time would be consumed)
$ ./a.out ../data.feat 2
$ ./a.out ../data.feat 3
$ ./a.out ../data.feat 4
$ ./a.out ../data.feat 5

Make sure that ../data.feat is available, and ../selected-feature-indices.txt is available.
If the data file and feature file is present somewhere else, the code can be run by:
./a.out data_file_location exptno feature_file_location


For generating data and selected features, make sure ../aclImdb is available.
$ g++ Q1.cpp
$ ./a.out
../data.feat and ../selected-feature-indices.txt would be generated
